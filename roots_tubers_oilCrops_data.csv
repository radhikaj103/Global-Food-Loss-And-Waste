1. Harvesting causes
-Carelessness and insufficient

thus spillage
-Lack of proper harvesting tools for
both maize and sunflower
2. Storage causes
-grain contamination - ground
drying
-Improper threshing - damage
-poor storage facilities - rodent
attack and leakage thus grain
spoilage
-Storage pest damage - loss in
